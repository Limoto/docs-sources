This section lists some of the adversaries and attackers within the
Automotive space

# Enthusiast Attackers
  Enthusiast attackers have physical access to the Engine Control
  Units (ECUs) at the circuit board level. They can solder ‘mod chips’
  onto the board and have access to probing tools. They also have
  information on ECUs that have been previously compromised and have
  access to softwares and instructions developed by other members
  of car modification forums. The goal of the enthusiast hacker
  could be, but is not limited to, adding extra horse power to the
  car or hacking it just for fun.

# Corrupt Automotive Dealers
  Corrupt automitive dealers are attackers that have access to the
  same capabilities as enthusiasts, but also have access to the car
  manufacturer's (OEM) dealer network. They may also have access to
  standard debugging tools provided by the car manufacturer. Their
  goal may be to support local car theft gangs or organized criminals.

# Organized Criminals
  Organized criminals have access to all of the above tools but may
  also have some level of control over the internal network at
  many dealerships. They may have hacked and gained temporary
  control of the Over-The-Air (OTA) servers or the In-Vehicle
  Infotainment (IVI) systems. This is very much like the role of
  organized criminals in other industries such as paid media today.
  Their goal is to extort money from OEMs and/or governments by
  threatening to disable multiple vehicles.

# Malware Developers
  Malware developers have developed malicious software to attack
  and compromise a large number of vehicles. The malicious software
  is usually designed to spread from one vehicle to another.
  Usually, the goal is to take control of multiple machines and then sell
  access to them for malicious purposes like denial-of-service (DoS)
  attacks or theft of private information and data.

# Security Researchers
  Security researchers are ‘self-publicized’ security consultants trying
  to make a name for themselves. They have access to standard tools for
  software security analysis. They also have physical access to the
  vehicle and standard hardware debugging tools (Logic Analyzers,
  Oscilloscopes, etc). Their goal is to publicize attacks for personal
  gain or just to gain personal understanding with a sense of helping make
  things more secure.
