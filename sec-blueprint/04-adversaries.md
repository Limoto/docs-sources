This section lists some of the adversaries and attackers in Automotive.

## Enthusiast Attackers

  Enthusiast attackers have physical access to the Engine Control
  Units (ECUs) at the circuit board level. They can solder ‘mod chips’
  onto the board and have access to probing tools. They also have
  information on ECUs that have been hacked previously and have
  access to softwares and instructions developed by other members
  of car modification forums. The goal of the enthusiast hacker
  could be, but is not limited to, adding extra horse power to the
  car or hacking it just for fun.
 
## Corrupt Dealers

  These are attackers that have access to the same capabilities as
  enthusiasts, but also have access to the car manufacturer's (OEM)
  dealer network. They may also have access to standard debugging
  tools provided by the car manufacturer. Their goal may be to support
  local car theft gangs or organized criminals.
 
## Organized Criminal

  Organized Criminals have access to all of the above tools but may
  also have some level of control over the internal network at
  many dealerships. They may have hacked and gained temporary
  control of the Over-The-Air (OTA) servers or the In-Vehicle
  Infotainment (IVI) systems. This is very much like the role of
  organized criminals in other industries such as paid media today.
  Their goal is to extort money from an OEMs and/or governments by
  threatening to disable multiple vehicles.
 
## Malware Developers

  Malware Developers have developed malicious software to attach
  and compromise a large number of vehicle. The malicious software
  would usually be designed spread from one vehicle to another.
  The goal usually is to take control of multiple machines then sell
  access to them for malicious purposes like denial-of-service (DoS)
  attacks or stealing private information and data.
 
## Security Researchers

  These attackers are ‘self-publicized’ security consultants trying
  to make a name for themselves. They have access standard tools for
  software security analysis. They also have physical access to the
  vehicle and standard hardware debugging tools (Logic Analyzers,
  Oscilloscopes, etc). Their goal is to publicize attacks for personal
  gains.
