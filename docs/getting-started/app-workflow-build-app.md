# 6. Create and Build the Application #

In general, you can create and build an application many different ways.
Tools and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) exist in various scenarios to allow you to
pick from whatever methodology or workflow with which you are comfortable.

This section uses XDS and the standard “hello world” application.

1. **Setup and Clone the Hello World Repository:**
   For information on how to get set up and then clone the Git repository for the
   "Hello World" application, see the
   "[Setup](../../../../../docs/devguides/en/dev/reference/xds/part-1/4-1_build-first-app-setup.html)"
   section.

2. **Build the Application:**
   For information on how to build the "Hello World" application using the XDS
   command line, see the
   "[Build using command line tool](../../../../../docs/devguides/en/dev/reference/xds/part-1/4-2_build-first-app-cmd.html)"
   section.

   For information on how to build the application using the XDS Dashboard, see the
