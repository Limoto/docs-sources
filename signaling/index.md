===== AGL Message Signaling (proposal) =====

==== Architecture Proposal ====

This [document](./architecture.md) presents a proposal of architecture for message signaling in AGL.

Also available as a [PDF Document](http://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/signaling/AGL-Message-Signaling-Architecture.pdf)

==== Documentation ====

Developer Guidelines are available as a [PDF Document](http://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/signaling/AGL-Message-Signaling-Developer-Guidelines.pdf) 

GPS Binding example is available on Github: [github:iotbzh/af-gps-binding](https://github.com/iotbzh/af-gps-binding)

==== OpenXC Demo ====

A reference HTML5 application has been developed: see [github:iotbzh/txc-demo](https://github.com/iotbzh/txc-demo).

This application uses a [OpenXC trace file](http://openxcplatform.com/resources/traces.html) to display 4 different panels representing live vehicle data.

It's available as an [AGL Application paclage](http://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/afb-demos/txc-demo_0.1.wgt) installable through AGL Application Framework.

==== Benchmarks ====

Some tests to evaluate the performances of the framework have been done by simulating CAN Data: [AGL-AppFW-CAN-Signaling-Benchmark.pdf](http://iot.bzh/download/public/2016/signaling/AGL-AppFW-CAN-Signaling-Benchmark.pdf)
