# Using CanRawView

***CanRawViewer*** is pretty simple to use, once simulation launched you'll see
signal flows in the window. You can use ***Clear*** button to wipe the window.

Use the ***Combine*** button to stack by arbitration ID the CAN signals.
Then only the latest signal for each arbitration ID will be displayed.
