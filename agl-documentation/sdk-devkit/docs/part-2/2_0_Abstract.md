# Part 2 - Build your 1st application

## Abstract

In the first part of this document, entitled "** Build AGL image from scratch**",
we rebuilt a complete bootable AGL image from source code. We also generated
and installed related SDK files in our development container.
This document describes the next step: using the SDK to build applications and
deploy them on a target board running an AGL image.

AGL DevKit as a whole contains:

- "**AGL Devkit - Image and SDK for porter**" guide for preparing a
  Docker container with AGL SDK, ready to build AGL applications
- Application templates and demos, allowing developers to start developing
  various types of applications:
  - Services
  - Native applications
  - HTML5 applications
  - ...
- This guide, focused on how to use these applications templates

*This document focuses on: initializing the SDK environment, building the
development templates, modifying them, and installing them on the
target.*
