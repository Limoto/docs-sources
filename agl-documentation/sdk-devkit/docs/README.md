# Introduction

AGL Development Kit allows developers and integrators to rebuild complete bootable images
from source code, as well as developing new applications for AGL.

It leverages Docker capabilities to propose a unified environment suitable for most development tasks:

* compatible with AGL 3.x (based on Yocto/Poky 2.x)
* support all AGL boards inc. reference boards (Renesas, Intel)
* low-level development of drivers
* system services development and integration
* applications development (build, deploy, debug) using AGL SDK and AGL Application Framework
